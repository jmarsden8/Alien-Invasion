In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the
bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship right & left using the arrow keys & shoot
bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, we will add an alien to the top left corner.
We will fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit
and create additional rows of aliens until we have a full fleet.
We will make the fleet move sideways and down, until the entire fleet is shot
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien hits the ground.
If the entire fleet is shot down, we will create a new fleet.
If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we will destroy the ship and create a
new fleet.
If the player loses 3 ships the game ends.
